# Welcome — Let’s get you started as a Unity Network Licence Operator

Welcome to selfdriven.tel.

You’re about to become part of a community-powered **telecommunications verification layer** — where everyday people help **verify real-world network performance** and earn rewards by running a lightweight app.

No hype.  
No complexity.  
Just participation.

Let’s get started.

---

## 🚀 Step 1 — Confirm your Operator access

You should already have:

✅ Your **Unity Network Licence Activation Code**  
✅ A link to download the **Operator App**

If not, check your inbox or reach out via the support channel.

Your activation code connects **you** to the Unity Network verification layer and enables rewards.

Keep it safe.

---

## 📲 Step 2 — Install the Operator App

1. Download the Operator App using the link provided.  
2. Install it on your phone or device.  
3. Open the app and enter your **Activation Code** when prompted.  

That’s it — you’re now registered as a **Unity Network Licence Operator**.

---

## ▶️ Step 3 — Run the App

Once activated:

- Leave the app running in the background  
- Keep your device online as much as possible  
- Allow notifications if prompted  

Your device now participates in **telecommunications verification**.

This is how you contribute — and how you earn.

---

## 📊 Step 4 — Monitor & Maintain

Think of this like a small nano-business:

- Check the app occasionally  
- Make sure it’s still running  
- Keep your device charged and connected  

Consistent uptime = more verification contribution = better rewards.

Simple.

---

## 💰 Step 5 — Earn Rewards

As your device helps verify real-world network behaviour, rewards accumulate automatically.

No trading.  
No speculation.  
Just participation → contribution → reward.

You’re helping create **transparent, verifiable telecommunications data** while creating a new income stream.

## 🤝 You’re Part of Something Bigger

You’re now one of many Operators worldwide helping build:

- Community-powered telecom verification
