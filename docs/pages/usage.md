# selfdriven AI Usage

The **selfdriven AI** framework demonstrates how communities, organisations, and practitioners can apply artificial intelligence within trusted, context-aware systems. By combining human identity, community intent, and structured knowledge, selfdriven AI transforms static information into dynamic, verifiable intelligence.

## Community-Based Intelligence Usage

**Community-Based Intelligence** is designed to help communities capture, organise, and activate their collective knowledge.

1. Each community begins by gathering its key documents — such as charters, plans, and discussions — and creating a **Vector Store** through the **selfdriven.network AI Interface**. This enables the community’s data to become machine-readable and contextually searchable.

2. A **Community Assistant** is then generated, equipped with a “System Card” derived from the *Community 5W1H Sheet*. This ensures the Assistant understands the community’s purpose, principles, and context.

3. Community members, authenticated via their **selfdriven Identity (SSI DID)**, can start conversations with the Assistant through the **selfdriven Human Interface** (the app). These interactions allow members to ask questions, explore insights, and co-create knowledge.

4. When appropriate, conversations can be shared with other community members — such as facilitators or practitioners — to enable collaboration, mentorship, or collective problem-solving.

### Implemented using a combination of:
- [octology](https://octology.io/) - definitions, constraints
- [selfdriven.network](https://selfdriven.network/) - Human, AI, SSI, Entity Interfaces
- [selfdriven Progessive Self-Actuation Framework](https://onboarding.selfdriven.foundation/framework/) - Community 5W1H Sheet
