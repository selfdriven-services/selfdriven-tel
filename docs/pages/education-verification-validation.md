## Education - What Unity Nodes Do: Verification, Not Judgement

Unity Nodes **verify** whether telecom services actually happened.  
They don’t decide what those services *mean* — they prove what occurred.

---

### Verification: establishing the facts

A Unity Node independently checks things like:
- Was a network signal present at a specific place and time?
- Did a device observe that signal in a verifiable way?
- Is the data authentic, untampered, and traceable to a real measurement?

This process is called **verification**.  
It’s objective, evidence-based, and designed to be checked by machines or humans later.

In simple terms:

**Verification answers:** “Did this telecom service actually occur?”

### What Unity Nodes don’t do

Unity Nodes **do not**:
- Decide whether coverage is “good enough”
- Interpret contracts, licences, or regulations
- Judge service quality or compliance
- Make payment or enforcement decisions

Those decisions depend on **context**, **policy**, and **rules** — and that’s a different step.

---

### Validation: applying meaning to verified facts

Once a Unity Node has verified the facts, others can **validate** them.

Validation might answer questions like:
- Does this meet a regulator’s coverage definition?
- Is this sufficient for a licence obligation?
- Should this trigger payment, penalties, or dispute resolution?
- Is this acceptable evidence for this use case?

Validation is performed by:
- Regulators
- Network operators
- Communities
- Insurers, auditors, or courts

Unity Nodes stay neutral. They provide **verified evidence**, not outcomes.

---

### Why this separation matters

By separating verification from validation:
- Facts remain neutral and reusable
- No single party controls interpretation
- Evidence can be trusted across disputes, jurisdictions, and use cases
- Decisions become transparent and accountable

---

### One-line summary

- **Unity Nodes verify that telecom services actually occurred.  
- Others validate those verified facts for regulation, payment, and compliance.**
